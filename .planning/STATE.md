# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-14 for v3.0 milestone)

**Core value:** A comprehensive engineering knowledge graph built from git history — every decision, bug fix, and pattern made searchable and interconnected with bidirectional backlinks.
**Current focus:** v3.0 milestone — requirements defined, roadmap pending

## Current Position

Phase: Not started (roadmap being created)
Plan: —
Status: Defining roadmap
Last activity: 2026-04-14 — Milestone v3.0 started

Progress: [__________] 0% (v3.0 not yet started)

## v3.0 Summary

Major architectural pivot:
- **Remove**: hooks, queue, retention, graphiti-core, LadybugDB, global graph
- **Replace**: SQLite + backlinks + FTS5 as knowledge graph backbone
- **Simplify**: single LLM provider (no fallbacks), 6-command CLI, clean module layout
- **Add**: two Claude skills, Claude plugin install path, semantic search via sqlite-vec (optional)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- [v3.0 planning]: Drop graphiti-core + LadybugDB entirely — bi-temporal model unnecessary when git provides temporal dimension; entity resolution complexity not justified for git history use case
- [v3.0 planning]: SQLite chosen over ChromaDB — structured queries + FTS5 + backlinks are primary access patterns; chromadb is vector-first and wrong fit
- [v3.0 planning]: No fallback chains in LLM config — single configured provider; simpler code, explicit failure
- [v3.0 planning]: Python stays (not TypeScript rewrite) — 500+ commit history, UI already TypeScript; backend rewrite in TS has no functional gain
- [v3.0 planning]: Plugin installs skills + MCP server — not CLI (user manages Python env separately); Claude plugin = skill wiring + MCP registration in ~/.claude/settings.json
- [v3.0 planning]: `recall sync` auto-inits silently if no DB — zero friction first-use; no prompt required
- [v3.0 planning]: Dual install paths — `pipx install recall-kg` for CLI users; `claude plugin install <repo>` for Claude users

### Pending Todos

(none — fresh milestone start)

### Blockers/Concerns

- Need to decide sqlite-vec version compatibility before IDX/KG implementation
- Plugin install mechanism needs research: how Claude Code plugin install actually works for Python packages
